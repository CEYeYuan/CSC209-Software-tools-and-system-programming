c scope rules:
	Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
	Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
		Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your
		program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined 
		for the program.
		A program can have same name for local and global variables but the 
		value of local variable inside a function will take preference.
	In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.

const:
	const means that something is not modifiable, so a data object that is 
	declared with const as a part of its type specification must not be assigned 
	to in any way during the run of a program.
static:
	1. A static variable inside a function keeps its value between invocations.
	2. A static global variable or a function is "seen" only in the file it's 
	   declared in
	3.Static functions are not visible outside of the C file they are defined in.

memory structure:
	heap->stack->data->text
where are they:
	const globals(read-only section)
	normal globals(read-write section)
	all the malloc(heap)
