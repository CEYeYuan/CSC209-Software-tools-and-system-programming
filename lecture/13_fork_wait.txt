int ret = fork();
//ret == 0			in the child process
//ret < 0			if fork fails
//return > 0 		parent process gets the children's pid

wait(&status)
//wait for one of the children to terminate
//status lowest 8 bits: if receive a signal
//status next 8 bits: 	the exited value
WIFEXITED(stat_val)
Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a child process that terminated normally.
WEXITSTATUS(stat_val)
If the value of WIFEXITED(stat_val) is non-zero, this macro evaluates to the low-order 8 bits of the status argument that the child process passed to _exit() or exit(), or the value the child process returned from main().
	
//diffirent between return and exit
	return only terminates the current function
	exit terminates the entire process
