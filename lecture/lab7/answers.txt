Question 1: Which lines of output are printed more than once?
line 11 and line 23 : B and E

Question 2: Write down all the different possible orders for the output Note 
that this includes output orders that you may not be able to reproduce.

the program would print A first, after the fork, child process would print 
B C E and parent process would print B D E, so all the possible order would be:

So the second phase has 6! different orders if several context switches can 
happen.which is around 720 different orders ! To simplify the question, I 
would just assumethere is only one context swith after the fork(since there 
is only a few lines of code to run, such assumption is reasonable)
	1. A B C E B D E (child first)
	2. A B D E B C E (parent first)

Question 3: How many processes are created including the original parent when
forkloop is called with 2, 3, and 4 as arguments?
	not include the main process
	2: 3 
	3: 7 
	4: 15

Question 4: Use an ASCII diagram to show the processes and their relationships
 when you run with 3 processes. For example, the diagram for simplefork with 
 two processes would be (assuming the process id of the parent is 414 and the
 process id of the child is 416)
 say 0 is the main process
 0->1(with i = 1)
 0->2(with i = 2)
 0->3(with i = 3 : can not fork more process)
 1->4(with i = 2)
 1->5(with 1 = 3 : can not fork more process)
 2->6(with 1 = 3 : can not fork more process)
 4->7(with 1 = 3 : can not fork more process)
